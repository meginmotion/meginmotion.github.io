  <h1>Veterans to Help Meet Harvey's Goals</h1>

  <h4>Chancellor Harvey Perlman has set an ambitious enrollment goal of 30,000 students by 2017.</h4> 
<p> In order to help achieve this challenge, the Student Veteran's Organization would like to propose building a Military and Veterans Center.</p>

  {% if SPREADSHEET_KEY %}

  <li> Increase the total student enrollment </li>
  <li> Provide added revenue to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln </li>
